## Implementation Notes

### Development Approach
- **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests for each component before implementation
- **Incremental Deployment**: Each task should result in deployable, testable code
- **Database First**: Establish data models early to ensure consistency
- **API First**: Create and test APIs before building UI components

### Integration Points
- **Existing WebSocket Service**: Extend `services/websocket_service.py` for trade monitoring
- **Smart Order Service**: Use `services/place_smart_order_service.py` for exit orders
- **Strategy Database**: Extend `database/strategy_db.py` with new risk management fields
- **Authentication**: Leverage existing `database/auth_db.py` for API key validation

### Key Dependencies
- **WebSocket Infrastructure**: Requires existing WebSocket proxy to be operational
- **Database Schema**: New tables must be created before service implementation
- **Order Management**: Integration with existing order placement and tracking systems
- **Real-Time Data**: Depends on broker WebSocket feeds for price updates

### Success Criteria
Each task is considered complete when:
1. Code is implemented and passes all tests
2. Integration with existing systems is verified
3. Error handling and edge cases are covered
4. Performance meets specified requirements
5. Documentation is updated

This implementation plan ensures systematic development of the Enhanced Trade Management Tool while maintaining compatibility with OpenAlgo's existing architecture and providing early validation opportunities at each stage.
