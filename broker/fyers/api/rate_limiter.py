"""
Shared rate limiting and 429-retry helpers for all Fyers API calls.

Fyers enforces a single global cap per API key across every REST endpoint --
order, data, quotes, depth, history, funds: 10 requests/second, 200/minute,
100000/day (see fyers-api-docs/FYERS_API_v3.md -> "Rate Limits"). Unlike Dhan,
which has independent per-endpoint-class limits (charts vs marketfeed), Fyers'
10 req/sec budget is shared process-wide, so pacing state MUST live in one
place that every module importing it sees -- not per BrokerData instance.

Services create a fresh BrokerData(auth_token) per request (see
services/option_chain_service.py, services/oi_tracker_service.py, etc.), so
any rate-limit state kept on `self` is reset away on every call and never
actually paces anything against concurrent requests. That was the root cause
of option-chain/depth bursts (many individual /data/depth calls for OI)
routinely exceeding the real 10 req/sec cap and getting HTTP 429'd.
