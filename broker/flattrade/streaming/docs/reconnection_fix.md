# Flattrade WebSocket Reconnection Issue and Fix

This document outlines a critical session management issue identified with the Flattrade WebSocket API and the corresponding architectural fix implemented in the OpenAlgo proxy.

## The Issue: Reconnection Failures

A recurring issue was observed where a client application (e.g., a strategy script) could not successfully reconnect to the WebSocket proxy immediately after disconnecting.

### Symptoms:

1.  A client connects and receives data successfully.
2.  The client disconnects (e.g., script is stopped).
3.  The client is immediately restarted and attempts to reconnect.
4.  The reconnection attempt fails with an authentication error from the WebSocket server, even though the `susertoken` (session key) is still valid.
5.  Restarting the main OpenAlgo application would temporarily resolve the problem, allowing the next connection to succeed.

### Root Cause Analysis:

The root cause is not the invalidation of the `susertoken`. Instead, it is a **server-side session cooldown period** imposed by Flattrade's WebSocket infrastructure.

- When a WebSocket connection is cleanly closed (`ws.close()`), the Flattrade server begins to tear down the session associated with that token.
- This cleanup process is not instantaneous.
- If a new connection attempt is made with the same token while the previous session is still in a "terminating" state, Flattrade's server rejects the new connection to prevent session conflicts.

This explains why a delay (like restarting the main app) allowed the connection to succeedâ€”it gave the server enough time to finish its cleanup.

## The Fix: Persistent Session Model

To create a more robust and efficient system, we moved from a transient connection model to a **persistent session model** specifically for the Flattrade adapter.

### Implementation Details:

1.  **`unsubscribe_all()` Method**: A new method, `unsubscribe_all()`, was added to the `FlattradeWebSocketAdapter`. This method sends unsubscribe requests for all active data streams (LTP, Quote, Depth) to Flattrade but **does not close the underlying WebSocket connection**.

2.  **Modified Proxy Cleanup Logic**: The `cleanup_client` method in `websocket_proxy/server.py` was updated. When the last client for a user disconnects:
    - **If the broker is Flattrade**: The proxy now calls `adapter.unsubscribe_all()`. The adapter remains connected and authenticated, ready for the next client.
    - **For all other brokers**: The original behavior is maintained; the adapter is fully disconnected by calling `adapter.disconnect()`.

### Benefits of This Approach:

-   **Reliability**: The fix completely sidesteps the server's unpredictable cooldown period, eliminating reconnection failures.
-   **Efficiency**: Maintaining an idle, authenticated connection is significantly less resource-intensive than repeatedly tearing down and re-establishing TCP, TLS, and WebSocket handshakes.
-   **Low Latency**: When a new client connects, it can subscribe and start receiving market data instantly, as the connection to the broker is already active. This is critical for trading applications.
