# Feature Specification: Add Python Menu

**Feature Branch**: `001-add-python-menu`  
**Created**: 2024-12-19  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "add python menu @http://127.0.0.1:5000/python/"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Access Python Strategy Management (Priority: P1)

Users need to easily access the Python strategy management functionality through the main navigation menu.

**Why this priority**: This is the primary way users will discover and access the existing Python strategy hosting system, which is already fully implemented but not visible in the navigation.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by adding a "Python" menu item to the navigation and verifying it links to the existing `/python` route that hosts the Python strategy management interface.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user is on any page of the application, **When** they look at the main navigation menu, **Then** they see a "Python" menu item
2. **Given** a user clicks the "Python" menu item, **When** the page loads, **Then** they are taken to the Python strategy management interface at `/python`
3. **Given** a user is on the Python strategy page, **When** they look at the navigation, **Then** the "Python" menu item is highlighted as active

---

### User Story 2 - Consistent Navigation Experience (Priority: P2)

The Python menu item should follow the same design patterns and behavior as other navigation items.

**Why this priority**: Ensures consistent user experience and maintains the established navigation patterns used throughout the application.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by comparing the Python menu item implementation with existing menu items to ensure consistent styling, hover effects, and active state handling.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user hovers over the "Python" menu item, **When** the hover state activates, **Then** it displays the same hover styling as other menu items
2. **Given** a user is on a mobile device, **When** they access the mobile navigation drawer, **Then** the "Python" menu item appears in the same position and style as other items
3. **Given** a user navigates to the Python page, **When** they view the navigation, **Then** the "Python" item shows the active state styling consistent with other active menu items

---

### User Story 3 - Mobile Navigation Support (Priority: P3)

The Python menu should be accessible through both desktop and mobile navigation interfaces.

**Why this priority**: Ensures the Python strategy functionality is accessible across all device types, maintaining feature parity with other navigation items.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by accessing the application on mobile devices and verifying the Python menu appears in the mobile drawer navigation.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user is on a mobile device, **When** they open the mobile navigation drawer, **Then** they see the "Python" menu item
2. **Given** a user taps the "Python" menu item on mobile, **When** the page loads, **Then** they are taken to the Python strategy management interface
3. **Given** a user is on the Python page on mobile, **When** they view the mobile navigation, **Then** the "Python" item is highlighted as active

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the Python strategy service is not available or returns an error?
- How does the navigation handle the case where the Python blueprint is not properly registered?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST display a "Python" menu item in the main navigation bar
- **FR-002**: System MUST link the "Python" menu item to the `/python` route
- **FR-003**: System MUST highlight the "Python" menu item as active when on Python strategy pages
- **FR-004**: System MUST include the "Python" menu item in mobile navigation drawer
- **FR-005**: System MUST apply consistent styling to the "Python" menu item matching other navigation items

### OpenAlgo-Specific Requirements

- **FR-ALGO-001**: Feature MUST be implemented using Python and Flask framework
- **FR-ALGO-002**: UI components MUST use DaisyUI standard for consistency
- **FR-ALGO-003**: Feature MUST include comprehensive test cases following TDD process
- **FR-ALGO-004**: Feature MUST be developed as independent file/method for upstream compatibility
- **FR-ALGO-005**: Feature MUST properly handle API keys through .env configuration system
- **FR-ALGO-006**: Feature MUST follow established broker adapter pattern if involving broker APIs
- **FR-ALGO-007**: Feature MUST meet performance standards (< 100ms order placement, < 200ms data retrieval)

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Navigation Menu**: The main navigation component that contains menu items and handles active states
- **Python Strategy Blueprint**: The existing Flask blueprint that handles Python strategy management at `/python` route

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can access Python strategy management in under 2 clicks from any page
- **SC-002**: Navigation menu loads and displays Python menu item in under 100ms
- **SC-003**: 100% of navigation menu items (including Python) follow consistent styling patterns
- **SC-004**: Python menu item is accessible on both desktop and mobile interfaces
- **SC-005**: Active state highlighting works correctly for Python menu item when on Python strategy pages

## Assumptions

- The existing Python strategy blueprint (`python_strategy_bp`) is properly registered and functional at `/python`
- The navigation templates (`navbar.html`, `base.html`) can be modified to add the new menu item
- DaisyUI styling classes are available for consistent menu item styling
- The mobile navigation drawer follows the same pattern as other menu items
- No additional authentication or permissions are required beyond existing user session management
