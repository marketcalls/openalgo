# Tasks: Add Python Menu

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-add-python-menu/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are included as requested in the feature specification (FR-ALGO-003: comprehensive test cases following TDD process)

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Web app**: Flask templates at repository root
- Paths shown below based on plan.md structure

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [x] T001 Verify Python strategy blueprint is registered in app.py
- [x] T002 [P] Create test directory structure for navigation testing
- [x] T003 [P] Setup pytest configuration for Flask testing
- [x] T004 [P] Verify DaisyUI and TailwindCSS are available for styling

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [x] T005 Verify Flask application is running and accessible
- [x] T006 Verify existing navigation templates are functional
- [x] T007 Verify Python strategy blueprint routes are accessible at /python
- [x] T008 [P] Create base test fixtures for navigation testing

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Access Python Strategy Management (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Users can access the Python strategy management functionality through the main navigation menu

**Independent Test**: Navigate to any page, verify "Python" menu item appears in navigation, click it to access /python route, verify active state highlighting works

### Tests for User Story 1 (TDD - Write First, Ensure They Fail)

- [x] T009 [P] [US1] Test Python menu item appears in desktop navigation in tests/test_navigation.py
- [x] T010 [P] [US1] Test Python menu item appears in mobile navigation in tests/test_navigation.py
- [x] T011 [P] [US1] Test Python menu item links to /python route in tests/test_navigation.py
- [x] T012 [P] [US1] Test active state highlighting for Python menu in tests/test_navigation.py

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [x] T013 [US1] Add Python menu item to desktop navigation in templates/navbar.html
- [x] T014 [US1] Add Python menu item to mobile navigation in templates/base.html
- [x] T015 [US1] Add Python menu item to alternative layout in templates/layout.html
- [x] T016 [US1] Implement active state logic using request.endpoint.startswith('python_strategy_bp.')
- [x] T017 [US1] Apply consistent DaisyUI styling classes to match existing menu items

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional and testable independently

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Consistent Navigation Experience (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Python menu item follows the same design patterns and behavior as other navigation items

**Independent Test**: Compare Python menu item with existing menu items to verify consistent styling, hover effects, and active state handling

### Tests for User Story 2 (TDD - Write First, Ensure They Fail)

- [x] T018 [P] [US2] Test hover state styling consistency in tests/test_navigation.py
- [x] T019 [P] [US2] Test active state styling consistency in tests/test_navigation.py
- [x] T020 [P] [US2] Test mobile navigation styling consistency in tests/test_navigation.py

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [x] T021 [US2] Verify hover state classes match existing menu items
- [x] T022 [US2] Verify active state classes match existing menu items
- [x] T023 [US2] Verify mobile drawer styling matches existing menu items
- [x] T024 [US2] Test responsive behavior across different screen sizes

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1 AND 2 should both work independently

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Mobile Navigation Support (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Python menu is accessible through both desktop and mobile navigation interfaces

**Independent Test**: Access application on mobile devices and verify Python menu appears in mobile drawer navigation

### Tests for User Story 3 (TDD - Write First, Ensure They Fail)

- [x] T025 [P] [US3] Test mobile drawer navigation functionality in tests/test_navigation.py
- [x] T026 [P] [US3] Test mobile menu item accessibility in tests/test_navigation.py
- [x] T027 [P] [US3] Test mobile active state highlighting in tests/test_navigation.py

### Implementation for User Story 3

- [x] T028 [US3] Verify mobile drawer navigation includes Python menu item
- [x] T029 [US3] Test mobile navigation on different devices and screen sizes
- [x] T030 [US3] Verify mobile active state highlighting works correctly
- [x] T031 [US3] Test mobile navigation performance and responsiveness

**Checkpoint**: All user stories should now be independently functional

---

## Phase 6: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Improvements that affect multiple user stories

- [x] T032 [P] Documentation updates in specs/001-add-python-menu/
- [x] T033 Code cleanup and refactoring
- [x] T034 [P] Performance testing for navigation load times (< 100ms)
- [x] T035 [P] Additional unit tests for edge cases in tests/unit/
- [x] T036 Security verification (no new security implications)
- [x] T037 Run quickstart.md validation
- [x] T038 Cross-browser testing for navigation consistency

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3)
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Depends on US1 for styling consistency
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Depends on US1 for mobile navigation

### Within Each User Story

- Tests (included) MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Template modifications before testing
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Test Python menu item appears in desktop navigation in tests/test_navigation.py"
Task: "Test Python menu item appears in mobile navigation in tests/test_navigation.py"
Task: "Test Python menu item links to /python route in tests/test_navigation.py"
Task: "Test active state highlighting for Python menu in tests/test_navigation.py"

# Launch template modifications together:
Task: "Add Python menu item to desktop navigation in templates/navbar.html"
Task: "Add Python menu item to mobile navigation in templates/base.html"
Task: "Add Python menu item to alternative layout in templates/layout.html"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1
   - Developer B: User Story 2
   - Developer C: User Story 3
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
